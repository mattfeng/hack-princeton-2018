# Inspiration
Two members of our team recently joined a service fraternity. In the process, we discovered a collegiate community and great opportunities to serve the community. One aspect we wished we had was a user-friendly application that would allow us to easily find not only events to attend in the wider Pittsburgh area but also people of like minds.
